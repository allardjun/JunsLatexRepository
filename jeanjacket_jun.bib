abstract = {{Actin-based vesicular trafficking of Cdc42, leading to a polarized concentration of the GTPase, has been implicated in cell polarization, but it was recently debated whether this mechanism allows stable maintenance of cell polarity. Here we show that endocytosis and exocytosis are spatially segregated in the polar plasma membrane, with sites of exocytosis correlating with microdomains of higher concentration and slower diffusion of Cdc42 compared with surrounding regions. Numerical simulations using experimentally obtained diffusion coefficients and trafficking geometry revealed that non-uniform membrane diffusion of Cdc42 in fact enables temporally sustained cell polarity. We show further that phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid recently found to be crucial for cell polarity, is enriched in Cdc42 microdomains. Weakening a potential interaction between phosphatidylserine and Cdc42 enhances Cdc42 diffusion in the microdomains but impedes the strength of polarization. These findings demonstrate a critical role for membrane microdomains in vesicular trafficking-mediated cell polarity. The mechanism by which proteins become polarized to a specific cortical site in budding yeast cells has been a topic of recent debate. Slaughter et al.show that differing diffusion rates of Cdc42 within plasma membrane environments sustain the polarized state.}},

Similarly, ECM-dependent interactions between tenocytes and cartilage/bone ensure that tendon-bone attachments form with the appropriate strength for the force required. Recent studies have also established a close lineal relationship between tenocytes and skeletal progenitors, highlighting the fact that defects in signals modulated by the ECM can alter the balance between these fates, as occurs in calcifying tendinopathies associated with aging. The dynamic fine-tuning of tendon ECM composition and assembly thus gives rise to the remarkable characteristics of this unique tissue type. Here, we provide an overview of the functions of the ECM in tendon formation and maturation that attempts to integrate findings from developmental genetics with those of matrix biology.}},

However, these parameters are difficult to determine in multicomponent assemblies such as integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs). We have previously applied 3D superresolution fluorescence microscopy to probe the spatial organization of major FA components, observing a nanoscale stratification of proteins between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Here we combine superresolution imaging techniques with a protein engineering approach to investigate how such nanoscale architecture arises. We demonstrate that talin plays a key structural role in regulating the nanoscale architecture of FAs, akin to a molecular ruler. Talin diagonally spans the FA core, with its N terminus at the membrane and C terminus demarcating the FA/stress fiber interface. In contrast, vinculin is found to be dispensable for specification of FA nanoscale architecture. Recombinant analogs of talin with modified lengths recapitulated its polarized orientation but altered the FA/stress fiber interface in a linear manner, consistent with its modular structure, and implicating the integrin–talin–actin complex as the primary mechanical linkage in FAs. Talin was found to be ∼97 nm in length and oriented at ∼15° relative to the plasma membrane. Our results identify talin as the primary determinant of FA nanoscale organization and suggest how multiple cellular forces may be integrated at adhesion sites.}},

Tether binding increases the activity of SHP-1 by 900-fold through a binding-induced allosteric activation (20-fold) and a more significant increase in local substrate concentration (45-fold). The reach parameter indicates that this local substrate concentration is exquisitely sensitive to receptor clustering. We further show that truncation of the tether leads not only to a lower reach but also to lower binding and catalysis.

We have used our recently reported 3D microtubule manipulation system to build filament crossings de novo in a purified in vitro environment and used them to assay kinesin-1–driven model cargo navigation. We found that 3D microtubule network geometry indeed significantly influences cargo routing, and in particular that it is possible to bias a cargo to pass or switch just by changing either filament spacing or angle. Furthermore, we captured our experimental results in a model which accounts for full 3D geometry, stochastic motion of the cargo and associated motors, as well as motor force production and force-dependent behavior.

Within minutes, the networks reach a dynamic steady-state with continuous inward flow. The networks exhibit homogeneous, density-independent contraction for a wide range of physiological conditions, implying that the myosin-generated stress driving contraction and the effective network viscosity have similar density dependence. We further find that the contraction rate is roughly proportional to the network turnover rate, but this relation breaks down in the presence of excessive crosslinking or branching. Our findings suggest that cells use diverse biochemical mechanisms to generate robust, yet tunable, actin flows by regulating two parameters: turnover rate and network geometry. Actomyosin networks with rapid turnover self-organize within droplets, forming a dynamic steady-state with persistent flows.

Profilin release can be directly promoted by formin actin polymerases even at saturating profilin-actin concentrations. We demonstrate that mammalian cells indeed operate at the limit to actin filament growth imposed by profilin and formins.

These phenomena include actomyosin punctuated contractions, or "actin asters" that form within quiescent F-actin networks. Punctuated contractions involve both formation of high intensity aster-like structures and disassembly of those same structures. Our 2D model allows us to explore the kinematics of filament polarity sorting, segregation of motors, and morphology of F-actin arrays that emerge as the model structure and biophysical properties are varied. Our model demonstrates the complex, emergent feedback between filament reorganization and motor transport that generate as well as disassemble actin asters. Since intracellular actomyosin dynamics are thought to be controlled by localization of scaffold proteins that bind F-actin or their myosin motors we also apply our 2D model to recapitulate in vitro studies that have revealed complex patterns of actomyosin that assemble from patterning filaments and motor complexes with microcontact printing. Although we use a minimal representation of filament, motor, and cross-linker biophysics, our model establishes a framework for investigating the role of other actin binding proteins, how they might alter actomyosin dynamics, and makes predictions that can be tested experimentally within live cells as well as within in vitro models.}},

These self-regulating structures undergo internal reorganization, which appears to minimize the surface area and maintain the ordered layering, even when undergoing aster merging events. Finally, the layered asters are metastable structures. Their lifetime, which ranges from minutes to hours, is encoded in the material properties of the composite.

Cytosim is an Open Source cytoskeleton simulation suite designed to handle large systems of flexible filaments with associated proteins such as molecular motors. It also offers the possibility to simulate passive crosslinkers, diffusible crosslinkers, nucleators, cutters, and discrete versions of the motors that only step on unoccupied lattice sites on a filament. Other objects complement the filaments by offering spherical or more complicated geometry that can be used to represent chromosomes, the nucleus, or vesicles in the cell. Cytosim offers simple command-line tools for running a simulation and displaying its results, which are versatile and do not require programming skills. In this workflow, step-by-step instructions are given to i) install the necessary environment on a new computer, ii) configure Cytosim to simulate the contraction of a 2D actomyosin network, and iii) produce a visual representation of the system. Next, the system is probed by systematically varying a key parameter: the number of crosslinkers. Finally, the visual representation of the system is complemented by the numerical quantification of contractility to view, in a graph, how contractility depends on the composition of the system. Overall, these different steps constitute a typical workflow that can be applied with few modifications to tackle many other problems in the cytoskeletal field.}},

We find that attractive interactions mimicking crowding effects or long microtubules both promote the formation of extensile nematic networks instead of asters. When microtubules are very long and the network is highly connected, a new isotropically motile network state resembling a “gliding mesh” is predicted. Using in vitro reconstitutions, we confirm the existence of this gliding mesh experimentally. These results provide a better understanding of how active microtubule network organization can be controlled, with implications for cell biology and active materials in general.}},

Cellular adaptation is made possible by molecular processes that strongly depend on mechanics. The actin cytoskeleton is also an active material that continuously consumes energy. This allows for dynamical processes that are possible only out of equilibrium and opens up the possibility for multiple layers of control that have evolved around this single protein. Here we discuss the actin cytoskeleton from the viewpoint of physics as an active adaptive material that can build structures superior to man-made soft matter systems. Actin can not only be used to build different network architectures on demand and in an adaptive manner, but it also exhibits the dynamical properties of feedback systems, like excitability, bistability, or oscillations. Therefore, it is a prime example of how biology couples physical structure and information flow and a role model for biology-inspired metamaterials.

Using finite element based discrete network (DN) modeling combined with stochastic crosslink scission kinetics, we correlate the microstructural damage evolution with the macroscopic stress–strain responses of these networks as a function of applied deformation rate. Simulations of multiple DN realizations for fixed filament density indicate that an incubation strain exists, which characterizes the minimum macroscopic deformation that a network should accrue before damage initiates. This incubation strain exhibits a direct relationship with the applied strain rate. Simulations predict that the critical damage fraction corresponding to colossal softening is quite low, which may be ascribed to the network non-affinity and filament reorientation. Furthermore, this critical fraction appears to be independent of applied strain rate. Based on these characteristics, we propose a phenomenological damage evolution law mimicking scission kinetics in an average sense. This law is embedded within an existing continuum model that is extended to include non-affine effects induced by filament bending.}},

Applying this method to a peptide gel model reveals a monotonic increase of the shear modulus as the soft, non-affine normal modes are successively suppressed as the driving frequency increases.

On the one hand, rigidity percolation shows that the limit of mechanical stability coincides with the emergence of floppy modes.

These two frameworks have offered alternative descriptions of the elasticity of disordered solids with central-force bonds, but the relationship between rigidity percolation and nonaffinity has remained unclear. As such, a unifying theory of real materials, i.e. those with covalent (noncentral) bonds, such as amorphous semiconductors, has been elusive. After briefly reviewing these theories, we present a mean-field argument which attempts to provide the unifying link between rigidity percolation and non-affinity. This framework yields analytical predictions of the shear modulus of covalent amorphous solids with potential applications to amorphous semiconductors and disordered carbon electronic materials.}},

Superresolution microscopy revealed that, in untreated cells, DAAM1 formed patches with a similar spatial arrangement to the actin nodes. Node movement (diffusion coefficient and velocity) in LatA-treated cells was dependent on the level and activity of myosin IIA, DAAM1, and FlnA.

This property, critical for the physiological function of tissues such as blood vessels, lung parenchyma and blood clots, has been documented since the nineteenth century, but the molecular structures and design principles responsible for it are unknown. Storm et al. now show that a much simpler theory can account for strain stiffening in a wide range of biopolymer gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins. According to this theory, systems of semiflexible chains such as filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked meshwork invariably stiffen at low strains without the need for a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffnesses. The mechanical properties of soft biological tissues are essential to their physiological function and cannot easily be duplicated by synthetic materials. Unlike simple polymer gels, many biological materials—including blood vessels1, mesentery tissue2, lung parenchyma3, cornea4 and blood clots5—stiffen as they are strained, thereby preventing large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity. The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress–strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force–extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly. This theory shows that systems of filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at low strains without requiring a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness.}},

We previously described such a network that forms upon Latrunculin A (LatA) treatment, in which formin DAAM1 was localized at these nodes. Knock down of DAAM1 reduced the mobility of actin nodes but the nodes remained. Here we have investigated DAAM1 containing nodes after LatA washout. DAAM1 was found to be distributed between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. The membrane binding likely occurs through an interaction with lipid rafts, but is not required for F-actin assembly. Interesting the forced interaction of DAAM1 with plasma membrane through a rapamycin-dependent linkage, enhanced F-actin assembly at the cell membrane (compared to the cytoplasm) after the LatA washout. However, immediately after addition of both rapamycin and LatA, the cytoplasmic actin nodes formed transiently, before DAAM1 moved to the membrane. This was consistent with the idea that DAAM1 was initially anchored to cytoplasmic actin nodes. Further, photoactivatable tracking of DAAM1 showed DAAM1 was immobilized at these actin nodes. Thus, we suggest that DAAM1 organizes actin filaments into a nodal complex, and such nodal complexes seed actin network recovery after actin depolymerization.}},

The asters can spontaneously position microparticles in the cores, along the radial ribbons, or by the outer rims depending on particle sizes and surface chemistry.

In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos active torque generation in the actomyosin layer promotes left–right symmetry breaking by driving chiral counterrotating cortical flows. While both Formins and Myosins have been implicated in left–right symmetry breaking and both can rotate actin filaments in vitro, it remains unclear whether active torques in the actomyosin cortex are generated by Formins, Myosins, or both. We combined the strength of C. elegans genetics with quantitative imaging and thin film, chiral active fluid theory to show that, while Non-Muscle Myosin II activity drives cortical actomyosin flows, it is permissive for chiral counterrotation and dispensable for chiral symmetry breaking of cortical flows. Instead, we find that CYK-1/Formin activation in RhoA foci is instructive for chiral counterrotation and promotes in-plane, active torque generation in the actomyosin cortex. Notably, we observe that artificially generated large active RhoA patches undergo rotations with consistent handedness in a CYK-1/Formin–dependent manner. Altogether, we conclude that CYK-1/Formin–dependent active torque generation facilitates chiral symmetry breaking of actomyosin flows and drives organismal left–right symmetry breaking in the nematode worm.}},

abstract = {{Myosin Va (myoVa) motors transport membrane-bound cargo through three-dimensional, intracellular actin filament networks. We developed a coarse-grained, in silico model to predict how actin filament density (3-800 filaments) within a randomly oriented actin network affects fluid-like liposome (350 nm vs. 1750 nm) transport by myoVa motors. Five thousand simulated liposomes transported within each network adopted one of three states: transport, tug-of-war, or diffusion. Diffusion due to liposome detachment from actin rarely occurred given at least 10 motors on the liposome surface. However, with increased actin density, liposomes transitioned from primarily directed transport on single actin filaments to an apparent random walk, resulting from a mixture of transport and tug-of-wars as the probability of encountering additional actin filaments increased. This phase transition arises from a percolation phase transition at a critical number of accessible actin filaments, Nc. Nc is a geometric property of the actin network that depends only on the position and polarity of the actin filaments, transport distance, and the liposome diameter, as evidenced by a fivefold increase in liposome diameter resulting in a fivefold decrease in Nc. Thus in cells, actin network density and cargo size may be regulated to match cargo delivery to the cell’s physiological demands.}},

abstract = {{The ability of cells to impart forces and deformations on their surroundings underlies cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and is thus an essential aspect of complex, metazoan life. Previous work has resulted in a refined understanding, commonly termed the molecular clutch model, of how cells adhering to flat surfaces such as a microscope coverslip transmit cytoskeletally generated forces to their surroundings. Comparatively less is known about how cells adhere to and exert forces in soft, three-dimensional (3D), and structurally heterogeneous ECM environments such as occur in vivo. We used time-lapse 3D imaging and quantitative image analysis to determine how the actin cytoskeleton is mechanically coupled to the surrounding matrix for primary dermal fibroblasts embedded in a 3D fibrin matrix. Under these circumstances, the cytoskeletal architecture is dominated by contractile actin bundles attached at their ends to large, stable, integrin-based adhesions. Time-lapse imaging reveals that α-actinin-1 puncta within actomyosin bundles move more quickly than the paxillin-rich adhesion plaques, which in turn move more quickly than the local matrix, an observation reminiscent of the molecular clutch model. However, closer examination did not reveal a continuous rearward flow of the actin cytoskeleton over slower moving adhesions. Instead, we found that a subset of stress fibers continuously elongated at their attachment points to integrin adhesions, providing stable, yet structurally dynamic coupling to the ECM. Analytical modeling and numerical simulation provide a plausible physical explanation for this result and support a picture in which cells respond to the effective stiffness of local matrix attachment points. The resulting dynamic equilibrium can explain how cells maintain stable, contractile connections to discrete points within ECM during cell migration, and provides a plausible means by which fibroblasts contract provisional matrices during wound healing.}},

abstract = {{Living systems provide a paradigmatic example of active soft matter. Cells and tissues comprise viscoelastic materials that exert forces and can actively change shape. This strikingly autonomous behavior is powered by the cytoskeleton, an active gel of semiflexible filaments, crosslinks, and molecular motors inside cells. Although individual motors are only a few nm in size and exert minute forces of a few pN, cells spatially integrate the activity of an ensemble of motors to produce larger contractile forces (∼nN and greater) on cellular, tissue, and organismal length scales. Here we review experimental and theoretical studies on contractile active gels composed of actin filaments and myosin motors. Unlike other active soft matter systems, which tend to form ordered patterns, actin–myosin systems exhibit a generic tendency to contract. Experimental studies of reconstituted actin–myosin model systems have long suggested that a mechanical interplay between motor activity and the network's connectivity governs this contractile behavior. Recent theoretical models indicate that this interplay can be understood in terms of percolation models, extended to include effects of motor activity on the network connectivity. Based on concepts from percolation theory, we propose a state diagram that unites a large body of experimental observations. This framework provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that drive cellular shape changes and also provides design principles for synthetic active materials.}},
